A default terrain file for any Django users who want to use the excellent
BDD package, "lettuce". (http://lettuce.it).

Put the terrain file in your project root. See accounts/feature/ for an
example usage -- this assumes you have an app called accounts which has 
a forms.py file and a RegistrationForm(forms.ModelForm), for example,
defined.

It uses selenium (http://seleniumhq.org) to do some of the checks.


Requirements:

* lettuce
* nose
* selenium
* lxml
* and of course, django.
